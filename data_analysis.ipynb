    "This project aims to use machine learning to predict maternal health risk based on key physiological factors. Maternal health are a major concern in healthcare. Hence, early risk assessment is crucial for the welfare of both the mother and child. By leveraging structured data from the Maternal Health Risk Dataset, we trained and evaluated machine learning models to classify maternal health risk levels into three different classes: low, mid, and high risk categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 1,014 records with features such as age, blood pressures, blood sugar levels, body temperature and heart rate. Our goal will be to determine whether machine learning algorithms could accurately predict risk levels based on these physiological markers and aid medical experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will carry out exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and preprocessing to the dataset and then apply multiple classification models including logistic regression, decision trees,___________, We might also carry out hyperparameter optimization and finally evaluate their accuracy and other classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC."

    "Maternal health is a critical area of healthcare, as complications during pregnancy and childbirth can have severe consequences for both mothers and newborns. Conditions such as hypertension, gestational diabetes, and abnormal heart rate patterns can indicate a higher risk of complications. Historically, risk assessment have been carried out by medical professionals that relied heavily on clinical expertise and constant monitoring. However, since the boom of machine learning, it began to offer a data-driven approach to enhance early detection and intervention, all while minimizing the involvement of overworked medical professionals."
