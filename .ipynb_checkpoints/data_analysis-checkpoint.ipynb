    "This project aims to use machine learning to predict maternal health risk based on key physiological factors. Maternal health are a major concern in healthcare. Hence, early risk assessment is crucial for the welfare of both the mother and child. By leveraging structured data from the Maternal Health Risk Dataset, we trained and evaluated machine learning models to classify maternal health risk levels into three different classes: low, mid, and high risk categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 1,014 records with features such as age, blood pressures, blood sugar levels, body temperature and heart rate. Our goal will be to determine whether machine learning algorithms could accurately predict risk levels based on these physiological markers and aid medical experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will carry out exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and preprocessing to the dataset and then apply multiple classification models including logistic regression, decision trees,___________, We might also carry out hyperparameter optimization and finally evaluate their accuracy and other classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC."

    "Maternal health can be defined as \"the health condition of women during preganancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period (WHO, 2025). This is a critical area of healthcare, as complications during preganancy and childbirth can lead to severe consequences for both mothers and newborns. According to the World Health Organization (2024), around 800 women died each day in 2020 due to preventable causes related to maternal health, further emphasizing the need for risk assessment measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, risk assessment have been carried out by medical professionals that relied heavily on clinical expertise and constant monitoring. However, traditional approaches to monitoring basic physiological indicators often lacked efficiency in identifying potential complications (Mu et al., 2023). Since the boom of machine learning (ML), many members of the academe have explored the use of ML in maternal health risk prediction, offering data-driven approaches to enhance early detection and intervention to offload the burden on overworked medical professionals (Mu et al., 2023; Ukrit et al., 2024; Bajaj et al., 2023).\n",
